# Note:
This is a very old project of mine that I worked on during the Covid-19 pandemic.\
I am making the repository public again for archival purposes.\
This project has not been under active development for almost three years now...\
The latest binary build does still work with Minecraft 1.16.5.\
I have not changed anything, and have opted to keep everything as it was three years ago.
